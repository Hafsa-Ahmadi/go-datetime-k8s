# Container Vulnerability Scanner: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Problem Overview
Organizations deploying containerized applications face significant security challenges in identifying and remediating vulnerabilities within their container images. These vulnerabilities can lead to security breaches, data leaks, and compliance violations. Current solutions are often:
- Too complex for non-security specialists to use effectively
- Siloed from development workflows
- Lacking in actionable remediation guidance
- Unable to prioritize vulnerabilities based on actual risk to the organization

The Container Vulnerability Scanner will provide a comprehensive, user-friendly solution that integrates directly into development and deployment pipelines, offering clear visibility into vulnerabilities and actionable remediation steps.

## User Personas

### DevOps Engineer (Primary)
**HAFSA, 22**
- Responsible for maintaining CI/CD pipelines and container infrastructure
- Needs to ensure containers meet security standards before deployment
- Wants to quickly identify and fix critical issues without deep security expertise
- Pain points: Balancing security requirements with deployment velocity

### Security Engineer (Secondary)
**ahamadi, 22**
- Responsible for security compliance across the organization
- Needs comprehensive vulnerability reports for audits
- Wants to establish security policies and thresholds
- Pain points: Lack of visibility into container security, inability to enforce policies

### Developer (Tertiary)
**Aiman, 22**
- Builds applications and creates Docker images
- Needs to understand security implications of dependencies
- Wants simple guidance on fixing vulnerabilities
- Pain points: Security tooling disrupts workflow and is difficult to understand

## User Journey

### DevOps Engineer Journey
1. Integrates scanner into CI/CD pipeline
2. Receives notification about scan results after image build
3. Reviews dashboard to see vulnerability summary
4. Prioritizes critical/high vulnerabilities for immediate remediation
5. Applies suggested fixes and triggers rescans
6. Approves images that meet security thresholds for deployment

### Security Engineer Journey
1. Sets up vulnerability policies and thresholds
2. Monitors overall security posture via dashboards
3. Reviews trends and patterns in vulnerability reports
4. Generates compliance reports for auditing purposes
5. Works with DevOps on remediation strategies for systemic issues

### Developer Journey
1. Scans container images during development
2. Receives immediate feedback on vulnerabilities
3. Views specific remediation guidance for identified issues
4. Implements fixes in code or Dockerfile
5. Verifies fixes with follow-up scans
